<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p>Welcome to Dashboard, which aims to be an umbrella for utility services for students at IIT Kanpur.</p>

<p>At present, we have three services, namely, a student search, a calendar for timetable and event tracking, and a service to act as a parser for the 'share auto/tempo' facebook group. </p>

<p>Dashboard is written as a series of microservices, which run in their own docker, and communicate via JSON RPC. This means that we can keep extending Dashboard by adding more services.</p>

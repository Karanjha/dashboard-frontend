# Contributing

This repository is the front-end for our dashboard. It's based on angular2,
so you need to install certain things to get started.

Please install `node` and `@angular2/cli`.
It's also recommended that you get `yarn` for development purposes.

Download the repository and run `yarn install`. Follow this up with `ng serve`.
Redirect your browser to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) where you
should see a running version for testing purposes. That's it!
You can make changes to the code inside the source, and they can be seen in this
testing environment.


## Some Tips:

  * Please put components inside `components/`, services inside `services/` and
  so on. This is not the default setting for ng-cli, so please be careful.
  * When editing an existing file, please maintain the indentation. Otherwise,
  use a consistent scheme for indentation.
  * A new feature should usually (but not always) correspond to a backend.
  Ask if unsure.

Please don't hesitate to join ##DashBoard on IRC (freenode) to talk to us.
